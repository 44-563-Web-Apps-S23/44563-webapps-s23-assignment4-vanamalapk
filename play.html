            ZAMA. Be you forgetting, child, 'tis said that evil ball shows only the
            way to destruction!

          OHANO. Yes, these island people will create any myth, go any length, to
            keep one thinking, living in their narrow way. You are destined for evil
            if you try to follow the urge of your own heart--oh, yes, I know.

            ZAMA. But _your_ heart, child, should only be wanting the love of Nijo.

            OHANO. Nijo--I am hoping that he will be big enough to help me--but my
            lover has been away so long----

            ZAMA. But to-day he be coming back--I came to tell you I think I saw his
            boat----

            OHANO. Nijo's boat? Where?

            ZAMA. It be near the edge of the island just where----

            OHANO. Why didn't you tell me before?

            ZAMA. I came to--but I be forgetting when I see you at that evil ball
            again.

            OHANO. [_All eagerness._] Perhaps we can see him land--from here on the
            rocks--come, Zama, I hear the sound of voices down near the sea--come!
            [_They climb to the highest rock._] Look, Zama, the boat is there!
            Already there in the green water against the shore!

            ZAMA. It do seem to be so. [_Peers toward right._

            OHANO. And _there_--is Nijo!

            ZAMA. Where, where, child?

            OHANO. There--see, he's just coming ashore--oh, Nijo! And look, Zama,
            look what the people crowding round him have done--look!

            ZAMA. What? My poor eyes be yet uncertain. What do they be doing to your
            lover?

            OHANO. They have put upon him the Robe of Flame--to greet him with the
            highest honor of the island.
